- **VS Code**: Minimum version 1.70
- **GitHub Copilot**: Active GitHub Copilot subscription required
- **Node.js**: For extension development and packaging

### 3.2 API Limitations

- **VoiceVox API**: Local REST API with specific endpoints
- **VS Code Extension API**: Limited to available extension points
- **GitHub Copilot API**: No official public API (requires workarounds)

## 4. User Stories

### 4.1 Primary User Stories

#### US-001: Basic Reading

```text
As a developer using GitHub Copilot Chat,
I want my chat responses to be read aloud automatically,
So that I can continue coding while listening to the guidance.
```

#### US-002: Voice Customization

```text
As a user with specific accessibility needs,
I want to customize the voice speed and character,
So that the speech is comfortable for me to understand.
```

#### US-003: Reading Control

```text
As a developer in a shared workspace,
I want to quickly mute or pause the reading,
So that I don't disturb my colleagues.
```

### 4.2 Secondary User Stories

#### US-004: Content Filtering

```text
As a developer receiving code examples,
I want code blocks to be announced appropriately,
So that I'm not overwhelmed by syntax reading.
```

#### US-005: Multi-language Support

```text
As a developer working with mixed-language content,
I want the system to handle both English and Japanese text,
So that all content is accessible.
```

## 5. Acceptance Testing Scenarios

### 5.1 Happy Path Scenarios

1. **Scenario**: New chat message received
   - **Given**: Extension is enabled and VoiceVox is running
   - **When**: GitHub Copilot sends a new chat response
   - **Then**: Message is read aloud within 2 seconds

2. **Scenario**: Voice customization
   - **Given**: User opens extension settings
   - **When**: User changes voice character to "ずんだもん"
   - **Then**: Next message uses the selected voice

### 5.2 Error Scenarios

1. **Scenario**: VoiceVox not available
   - **Given**: VoiceVox is not running
   - **When**: New chat message is received
   - **Then**: User sees error notification with resolution steps

2. **Scenario**: Long message handling
   - **Given**: Chat response is over 1000 characters
   - **When**: Message is processed for TTS
   - **Then**: Message is appropriately chunked and read clearly
