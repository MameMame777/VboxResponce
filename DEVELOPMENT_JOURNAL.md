# VoiceVox Copilot Notifier - Development Journal

## Project Overview

A VS Code extension that provides voice notifications for GitHub Copilot Chat completion using VoiceVox text-to-speech engine.

## Development Timeline

### 2025-07-27: Project Initialization and Core Development

#### Initial Setup and Requirements#### Development Status Summary

✅ **Completed Successfully**:

- Core voice notification system with 4 character voices
- Configuration management and status bar integration
- Audio asset generation and playback system
- False positive elimination through systematic threshold adjustment
- Balanced detection logic implementation

🔄 **In Progress**:

- **Critical Issue**: Basic text change detection not functioning
- Real Copilot Chat interaction detection validation
- Fine-tuning detection patterns for actual usage scenarios

❌ **Current Problems**:

- **Text Change Detection Failure**: "test copilot" input test shows no audio response
- **No Console Logs**: Text change events may not be firing at all
- **Detection Pipeline Issue**: Either event registration or callback execution failing

✅ **Confirmed Working**:

- **AudioManager System**: "VoiceVox: Test Audio Playbook" command executes successfully with audio playback
- **Extension Initialization**: Status bar icon (🔊) visible and functional
- **Configuration System**: Extension properly loaded and configured
- **Audio Assets**: All voice character files accessible and playable

#### Root Cause Analysis 🔍

**Problem Isolation**: Since AudioManager works perfectly, the issue is specifically in the **text change event detection system**. The following components need investigation:

1. **Event Registration**: `vscode.workspace.onDidChangeTextDocument` may not be registering properly
2. **CopilotMonitor Initialization**: Text monitoring setup may be failing during extension startup
3. **Event Callback Execution**: Registered events may not be triggering the callback functions
4. **Disposables Management**: Event listeners may be getting disposed prematurely

#### New Symptom Discovery 🎯

**Random Audio Playback Detected**: User reports that "お疲れさまでした" audio plays randomly without apparent trigger:

- **Positive Finding**: Audio system is definitely functional and being triggered
- **Detection System Active**: Some form of completion detection is working
- **Likely Cause**: Periodic test notifications (30-second interval) from `simulateCompletionDetection()`
- **Console Output Missing**: No Extension Host logs appearing in Output panel suggests logging redirection issue

**Analysis**: The random audio suggests that:
1. **Periodic Test Timer**: 30-second interval test notifications are functioning
2. **Text Change Events**: Not firing or not logging properly
3. **Extension Initialization**: Partially working (timer-based features active, event-based features failing)

#### Immediate Debugging Steps Required

1. **Console Log Verification**: Check Developer Tools Console for any text change event logs
2. **Event Registration Validation**: Verify that `onDidChangeTextDocument` listeners are properly registered
3. **Extension Initialization Check**: Confirm that CopilotMonitor is fully initialized and monitoring
4. **Simple Detection Test**: Enhanced logging for every character input to identify where detection fails

#### Enhanced Debugging Implementation ⚡

**New Debug Features Added**:

- **Comprehensive Text Change Logging**: Every text modification logged with full details
- **Multiple Trigger Conditions**: "test", "copilot", and character count-based triggers
- **Periodic Test Notifications**: 30-second interval notifications to verify audio system
- **Detailed Event Analysis**: Document info, change count, and text content preview

**Expected Console Output When Typing "test"**:
```
=== TEXT DOCUMENT CHANGE EVENT DETECTED ===
Document: [filename]
Content changes count: 1
Change text: "test"
🔥 TEST TRIGGER DETECTED: "test" phrase found
→ Triggering test completion notification
```

**If No Logs Appear**: Event registration or extension initialization failuretive**: Create a VoiceVox integration for GitHub Copilot Chat responses in VS Code
- **Initial Scope**: Full text-to-speech reading of Copilot responses
- **Revised Scope**: Voice notifications for completion events (simpler, more practical)
- **Architecture Decision**: VS Code extension approach rather than external executable

#### Technical Foundation
- **VoiceVox Integration**: Successfully connected to VoiceVox REST API (localhost:50021)
- **Project Structure**: Created modular TypeScript architecture
- **Development Environment**: Node.js v24.4.1, TypeScript, VS Code Extension API

### 2025-07-27: False Positive Resolution and Real Detection Challenge

#### False Positive Issue Resolution ✅

- **Problem**: Extension was triggering audio notifications without actual user Copilot Chat interaction
- **Root Causes Identified**:
  - Window focus monitoring creating spurious triggers
  - Overly frequent output channel checking
  - Text change detection with low thresholds
  - Random simulation functions interfering
- **Solution Implemented**: Systematic modification of detection logic
  - Disabled window focus monitoring completely
  - Reduced output channel checking frequency (10s → 30s intervals)
  - Increased text insertion thresholds (100+ chars → 200+ chars, 5+ lines → 10+ lines)
  - Increased cooldown periods (3s → 5s)
  - Disabled all simulation functions
  - Added file type filtering (excluded JSON, system folders)

#### Current Challenge: Real Copilot Chat Detection 🔄

- **Status**: Test audio works perfectly, but no notifications during actual Copilot Chat usage
- **Analysis**: Detection thresholds may have been overcorrected, missing legitimate interactions
- **Console Output**: Shows proper initialization and monitoring setup, but no detection triggers during chat usage

#### Balanced Detection Approach Implementation 🔧

- **Text Change Thresholds**: Reduced from 200 chars to 50 chars, 10 lines to 3 lines
- **File Type Filtering**: Removed overly restrictive JSON/JSONC exclusions
- **Notification Timing**: Reduced delay from 2s to 1s for responsiveness
- **Cooldown Period**: Balanced from 5s to 3s
- **Panel Detection**: Increased frequency from 10s to 5s intervals
- **Output Channel Monitoring**: Partially re-enabled with careful logic

#### Next Priority: Enhanced Real-World Detection Strategy

**Immediate Action Plan**:

1. **Manual Copilot Chat Testing**: Use extension during actual Copilot interactions to gather detection data
2. **Console Log Analysis**: Monitor what triggers are actually firing during real usage
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify specific text patterns unique to Copilot responses
4. **DOM Inspection**: Investigate actual Copilot Chat DOM structure for better detection hooks

**Technical Investigation Needed**:

- **Copilot Response Patterns**: Analyze actual response text for detection signatures
